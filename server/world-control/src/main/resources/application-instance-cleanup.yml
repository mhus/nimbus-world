# This file contains example configuration for automatic cleanup of unused world instances.
# Copy these settings to your main application.yml or create an application-instance-cleanup.yml profile.

    cleanup:
      # Enable/disable automatic cleanup (default: true)

      # Instances with updatedAt older than this will be deleted
